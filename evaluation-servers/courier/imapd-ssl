#  This configuration file sets various options for the Courier-IMAP server
#  when used to handle SSL IMAP connections.
#
#  SSL and non-SSL connections are handled by a dedicated instance of the
#  couriertcpd daemon.  If you are accepting both SSL and non-SSL IMAP
#  connections, you will start two instances of couriertcpd, one on the
#  IMAP port 143, and another one on the IMAP-SSL port 993.

#
##NAME: SSLPORT:1
#
#  Options in the imapd-ssl configuration file AUGMENT the options in the
#  imapd configuration file.  First the imapd configuration file is read,
#  then the imapd-ssl configuration file, so we do not have to redefine
#  anything.
#
#  However, some things do have to be redefined.  The port number is
#  specified by SSLPORT, instead of PORT.  The default port is port 993.
#
#  Multiple port numbers can be separated by commas.  When multiple port
#  numbers are used it is possibly to select a specific IP address for a
#  given port as "ip.port".  For example, "127.0.0.1.900,192.168.0.1.900"
#  accepts connections on port 900 on IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.0.1
#  The SSLADDRESS setting is a default for ports that do not have
#  a specified IP address.

SSLPORT=993

##NAME: SSLADDRESS:0
#
#  Address to listen on, can be set to a single IP address.
#
# SSLADDRESS=127.0.0.1

SSLADDRESS=0

##NAME: SSLPIDFILE:0
#
# That's the SSL IMAP port we'll listen on.
# Feel free to redefine MAXDAEMONS, TCPDOPTS, and MAXPERIP.

SSLPIDFILE=/run/courier/imapd-ssl.pid

##NAME: SSLLOGGEROPTS:0
#
# courierlogger(1) options.
#

SSLLOGGEROPTS="-name=imapd-ssl"

##NAME: IMAPDSSLSTART:0
#
# Different pid files, so that both instances of couriertcpd can coexist
# happily.
#
# You can also redefine IMAP_CAPABILITY, although I can't
# think of why you'd want to do that.
#
#
# Ok, the following settings are new to imapd-ssl:
#
#  Whether or not to start IMAP over SSL on simap port:

IMAPDSSLSTART=NO

##NAME: IMAPDSTARTTLS:0
#
#  Whether or not to implement IMAP STARTTLS extension instead:

IMAPDSTARTTLS=YES

##NAME: IMAP_TLS_REQUIRED:1
#
# Set IMAP_TLS_REQUIRED to 1 if you REQUIRE STARTTLS for everyone.
# (this option advertises the LOGINDISABLED IMAP capability, until STARTTLS
# is issued).

IMAP_TLS_REQUIRED=1


#########################################################################
#
# The following variables configure IMAP over SSL.  If OpenSSL or GnuTLS
# is available during configuration, the couriertls helper gets compiled, and
# upon installation a dummy TLS_CERTFILE gets generated.
#
# WARNING: Peer certificate verification has NOT yet been tested.  Proceed
# at your own risk.  Only the basic SSL/TLS functionality is known to be
# working. Keep this in mind as you play with the following variables.
#
##NAME: COURIERTLS:0
#

COURIERTLS=/usr/bin/couriertls

##NAME: TLS_PRIORITY:0
#
# GnuTLS setting only (use TLS_CIPHER_LIST for OpenSSL)
#
# Set TLS protocol priority settings
#
# DEFAULT: NORMAL:-CTYPE-OPENPGP
#
# This setting is also used to select the available ciphers.
#
# The actual list of available ciphers depend on the options GnuTLS was
# compiled against. The possible ciphers are:
#
# AES256, 3DES, AES128, ARC128, ARC40, RC2, DES, NULL
#
# Also, the following aliases:
#
# HIGH -- all ciphers that use more than a 128 bit key size
# MEDIUM -- all ciphers that use a 128 bit key size
# LOW -- all ciphers that use fewer than a 128 bit key size, the NULL cipher
#        is not included
# ALL -- all ciphers except the NULL cipher
#
TLS_PRIORITY="NORMAL:-VERS-SSL3.0:-VERS-TLS1.0:-VERS-TLS1.1:+VERS-TLS1.2"
# See GnuTLS documentation, gnutls_priority_init(3) for additional
# documentation.

##NAME: TLS_PROTOCOL:0
#
# TLS_PROTOCOL sets the protocol version.  The possible versions are:
#
# OpenSSL:
#
# TLSv1 - TLS 1.0, or higher.
# TLSv1.1 - TLS1.1, or higher.
# TLSv1.1++ TLS1.1, or higher, without client-initiated renegotiation.
# TLSv1.2 - TLS1.2, or higher.
# TLSv1.2++ TLS1.2, or higher, without client-initiated renegotiation.
#
# The default value is TLSv1

##NAME: TLS_CIPHER_LIST:0
#
# OpenSSL only (use TLS_PRIORITY for GnuTLS):
#
# TLS_CIPHER_LIST optionally sets the list of ciphers to be used by the
# OpenSSL library.  In most situations you can leave TLS_CIPHER_LIST
# undefined
#
# TLS_CIPHER_LIST="TLSv1:HIGH:!LOW:!MEDIUM:!EXP:!NULL:!aNULL@STRENGTH"
#
# See the OpenSSL ciphers(1) manual page for the format of this setting.

##NAME: TLS_STARTTLS_PROTOCOL:0
#
# TLS_STARTTLS_PROTOCOL is used instead of TLS_PROTOCOL for the IMAP STARTTLS
# extension, as opposed to IMAP over SSL on port 993.
#
# It takes the same values for OpenSSL as TLS_PROTOCOL
TLS_PROTOCOL="TLSv1.2"
TLS_STARTTLS_PROTOCOL="TLSv1.2"

##NAME: TLS_MIN_DH_BITS:0
#
# TLS_MIN_DH_BITS=n
#
# GnuTLS only:
#
# Set the minimum number of acceptable bits for a DH key exchange.
#
# GnuTLS's compiled-in default is 727 bits (as of GnuTLS 1.6.3). Some server
# have been encountered that offer 512 bit keys. You may have to set
# TLS_MIN_DH_BITS=512 here, if necessary.

##NAME: TLS_TIMEOUT:0
# TLS_TIMEOUT is currently not implemented, and reserved for future use.
# This is supposed to be an inactivity timeout, but its not yet implemented.
#

##NAME: TLS_CERTFILE:0
#
# TLS_CERTFILE - certificate to use. TLS_CERTFILE must be owned
# by the "courier" user, and must not be world-readable.
#
# VIRTUAL HOSTS ON THE SAME IP ADDRESS.
#
# Install each certificate $TLS_CERTFILE.domain, so if TLS_CERTFILE is set to
# /etc/certificate.pem, then you'll need to install the actual certificate
# files as /etc/certificate.pem.www.example.com,
# /etc/certificate.pem.www.domain.com and so on. Then, create a link from
# $TLS_CERTFILE to whichever certificate you consider to be the main one,
# for example:
# /etc/certificate.pem => /etc/certificate.pem.www.example.com
#
# IP-BASED VIRTUAL HOSTS:
#
# There may be a need to support older SSL/TLS client that don't support
# virtual hosts on the same IP address, and require a dedicated IP address
# for each SSL/TLS host. If so, install each certificate file as
# $TLS_CERTFILE.aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd, where "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd" is the IP address
# for the certificate's domain name. So, if TLS_CERTFILE is set to
# /etc/certificate.pem, then you'll need to install the actual certificate
# files as /etc/certificate.pem.192.168.0.2, /etc/certificate.pem.192.168.0.3
# and so on, for each IP address.
#
# In all cases, $TLS_CERTFILE needs to be linked to one of the existing
# certificate files.

TLS_CERTFILE=/etc/ssl/cert-data/tls-server-chain.crt

##NAME: TLS_PRIVATE_KEYFILE:0
#
# TLS_PRIVATE_KEYFILE - SSL/TLS private key for decrypting peer data.
# This file must be owned by the "courier" user, and must not be world
# readable, and must be accessible without a pass-phrase, i.e. it must not
# be encrypted.
#
# By default, courier generates SSL/TLS certifice including private key
# and install it in TLS_CERTFILE path, so TLS_PRIVATE_KEYFILE is completely
# optional. If TLS_PRIVATE_KEYFILE is not set (default), TLS_CERTFILE is
# treated as certificate including private key file.
#
# If you get SSL/TLS certificate and private key from trusted certificate
# authority(CA) and want to install them separately, TLS_PRIVATE_KEYFILE can
# be used as private key file path setting.
#
# VIRTUAL HOSTS ON THE SAME IP ADDRESS.
#
# $TLS_PRIVATE_KEYFILE.domain and $TLS_CERTFILE.domain are a pair.
# If you use VIRTUAL HOST feature on TLS_CERTFILE setting, you must set pair
# private key as $TLS_PRIVATE_KEYFILE.domain. Then, create a link from
# $TLS_PRIVATE_KEYFILE to whichever private key you consider to be the main one.
# for example:
# /etc/tls_private_keyfile.pem => /etc/tls_private_keyfile.pem.www.example.com
#
# IP-BASED VIRTUAL HOSTS:
#
# Just described on "VIRTUAL HOSTS ON THE SAME IP ADDRESS" above,
# $TLS_PRIVATE_KEYFILE.aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd and $TLS_CERTFILE.aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd are
# a pair. If TLS_PRIVATE_KEYFILE is set to /etc/tls_private_keyfile.pem,
# then you'll need to install the actual certificate files as
# /etc/tls_private_keyfile.pem.192.168.0.2, /etc/tls_private_keyfile.192.168.0.3
# and so on, for each IP address.
#
# In all cases, $TLS_PRIVATE_KEYFILE needs to be linked to one of the existing
# certificate files.
#
TLS_PRIVATE_KEYFILE=/etc/ssl/cert-data/tls-server.key

##NAME: TLS_DHPARAMS:0
#
# TLS_DHPARAMS - DH parameter file.
#
TLS_DHPARAMS=/usr/share/dhparams.pem

##NAME: TLS_TRUSTCERTS:0
#
# TLS_TRUSTCERTS=pathname - load trusted certificates from pathname.
# pathname can be a file or a directory. If a file, the file should
# contain a list of trusted certificates, in PEM format. If a
# directory, the directory should contain the trusted certificates,
# in PEM format, one per file and hashed using OpenSSL's c_rehash
# script. TLS_TRUSTCERTS is used by SSL/TLS clients (by specifying
# the -domain option) and by SSL/TLS servers (TLS_VERIFYPEER is set
# to PEER or REQUIREPEER).
#

TLS_TRUSTCERTS=/etc/ssl/certs/

##NAME: TLS_VERIFYPEER:0
#
# TLS_VERIFYPEER - how to verify client certificates.  The possible values of
# this setting are:
#
# NONE - do not verify anything
#
# PEER - verify the client certificate, if one's presented
#
# REQUIREPEER - require a client certificate, fail if one's not presented
#
#
TLS_VERIFYPEER=NONE

##NAME: TLS_EXTERNAL:0
#
# To enable SSL certificate-based authentication:
#
# 1) TLS_TRUSTCERTS must be set to a pathname that holds your certificate
#    authority's SSL certificate
#
# 2) TLS_VERIFYPEER=PEER or TLS_VERIFYPEER=REQUIREPEER (the later settings
#    requires all SSL clients to present a certificate, and rejects
#    SSL/TLS connections without a valid cert).
#
# 3) Set TLS_EXTERNAL, below, to the subject field that holds the login ID.
#    Example:
#
#  TLS_EXTERNAL=emailaddress
#
# The above example retrieves the login ID from the "emailaddress" subject
# field. The certificate's emailaddress subject must match exactly the login
# ID in the courier-authlib database.

##NAME: TLS_CACHE:1
#
# A TLS/SSL session cache may slightly improve response for IMAP clients
# that open multiple SSL sessions to the server.  TLS_CACHEFILE will be
# automatically created, TLS_CACHESIZE bytes long, and used as a cache
# buffer.

TLS_CACHEFILE=/var/spool/courier/couriersslimapcache
TLS_CACHESIZE=524288

##NAME: TLS_ALPN:0
#
# Application level protocol negotiation should be enabled by default, and
# should be commented out only in case of compatibility issues.

TLS_ALPN=imap

##NAME: MAILDIRPATH:0
#
# MAILDIRPATH - directory name of the maildir directory.
#
MAILDIRPATH=Maildir
